# Installation

Free Pascal Compiler version 3.2.2 can be installed directly from the package manager for a wide variety of platforms and systems.
If it's not available for your system/platform or if you want to install the Free Pascal in your home directory, you can get binaries from [Free Pascal - Download][fpc-download], unpack the tarball, run the ```install.sh``` and append the ```$HOME/fpc-3.2.2/bin``` to the ```PATH``` environment variable.

For other installation options and/or a more detailed description, please visit [Installing the Free Pascal Compiler - Free Pascal wiki][fpc-install-wiki].
