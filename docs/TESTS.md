# Tests

The ```make``` utility is a dependency to run the tests.

From within the exercise directory, type in a console/terminal:

```sh
make
```

If you didn't even touch the exercise solution file, you'll see a message like:

```
Please implement your solution.
```

So, remove this line before start to write your solution.

By default only the first test is executed.

To run all tests, type:

```sh
make test=all
```

All tests must have an "ok" status for the solution to be accepted.
